Family Guy, The Simpsons, and other shows on TV now are re-using jokes and going for the easy laugh with sex jokes, but Bob's Burgers has smart comedy that often hits you a few minutes later.

While Groening and MacFarlane are cartoon tycoons currently dominating animated programming, Bob's Burgers is a pleasing, utterly enjoyable change.The pace and rapport of all the characters is one that is rare in any other cartoons. This pace is further backed up by the exceptional vocal performances and direction. Bob's monotonous exasperation at his children's outbursts is just hilarious. The script and dialogue of Tina, Gene and Louise is superb. Tina's voice, personally, I find extremely funny. The humour of a situation slowly evading Bob, mainly, is well accommodated by the episode lengths.I haven't laughed so hard at a comedy since that seen in The US Office where they all start singing staying alive by the bee gees to keep the beat for CPR of the practice dummy.\",\n",

It's hard to keep track of the good with all of the carp that some how makes it into our homes. I am so glad to say that Bobs Burger is one of those shows that you will be happy found it's way. Many things made this show be added to my favorite list and my DVR. Firstly, I love the animation. Instead of trying to look like Family Guy, The Simpsons or King of the Hill, this show stands out as looking completely different. It is gritty and looks like something that would have been on MTV in the mid 80s or early 90s. That makes me like it even more. I am writing a kids book and seeing stuff like this makes me feel good. Not everything has to look so polished. Another thing I like is the dark humor. It is the kind of thing that if you stop paying attention for just a minute, you won't get something later. I actually laughed out loud at this time after time. Which is rare these days. Something else I like about this show is the people doing the voices. Especially H. Jon Benjamin. The story I saw was really funny and memorable. All these things make me really excited about the next episode.I must say though, I have a bad feeling Fox is going to boot this show. It just does not fit in with there other shows. Everything on Sunday nights looks the same. This seems like it would fit better on Adult Swim or Comedy Central. So let us all hope Fox is smart and keeps this show on. I am already excited about getting a season pass and buying it on Blu Ray when it is available!!!!\",\n",

The entire cast playing the Belchers is spot on and only gets better with each episode. This show has a new and fresh vibe to it, but also has a certain familiar attribute; a family trying to do the best that they can with what they have and having a little fun along the way. A surprisingly exceptional character is found in Louise, played by Kristen Schaal. While all the characters have redeeming qualities of their own, Louise's character is in my opinion one of the most exuberantly funny. She is the comic relief more often than not. Each episode takes you on a new adventure, theme, idea, premise, etc.. Lots of variety keeps the show interesting. Overall- Outstanding series, but could use more of Regular Sized Rudy.\",\n",

Other reviewers seem disappointed that the humor included fart jokes and that it doesn't adequately fill the spot following the Simpson's.

       " {'content': 'When I first saw the commercials about a new cartoon-series I wasn\\'t really impressed. Bobs burgers, about a burgershop, really..? The style was a strong reminder of Beavis and Butthead and the short commercial didn\\'t really impress me much. Maybe I was a bit skeptical because the last years no cartoon or animation series has impressed me much. Brickleberry for example never made me laugh and I didn\\'t like any of the characters.When it comes to that, TV is riddled with the McFarlane cartoons and even though I still like family guy (not love), its all becoming a tad repetitive.So I gave Bob\\'s Burgers a chance. I had to get used to the style and wasn\\'t convinced a Burgershop could deliver anything fun, but after a few ep\\'s I am pleasantly surprised. The pace is really good, dialogs are fast and you have to take notice of all or you will miss a joke or clever pun. The cartoon-style works, it gives a bit of 80\\'s nostalgia and it just looks funny - seeing Louise go nuts wearing those ears is just a funny sight.The characters all work for me, I noticed a lot dislike Gene but I can see him fit in. He delivers a lot of clever (superfast) jokes (scrotumwax!) so for me he adds.Even the \\'recurring characters\\' deliver, my fav would be Teddy (\"we need a bigger restaurant!\").All in all its well-made and reasonably original (wich is rare these days) and it\\'s actually funny.

I am certainly going to be watching this show again if not mainly for the voice of H. Jon Benjamin. He's the voice of the movie buff in family guy who always talks with Chris about random boob shots.

Jon Benjamin who has previously worked with Bouchard on Home Movie's (as Coach McGuirk) is an excellent choice for Bob. The Sunday night slot is in dire need for new comedy that isn't the Simpson's or Seth MacFarlane and Bob's Burger seem to fill that void.In the first episode The Health inspector drops by with several complaints about Bob's Restaurant, the youngest daughter Louise seems to be starting the most trouble for the Re'Re'Re opening of the restaurant by changing Bob's special New Bacon-Ings- Comes with bacon to The Child Molester Comes with candy. That's just a bit of what happens in the first episode and i don't want to reveal anything else and ruin it for the people who haven't had a chance to see it yet, in conclusion Bob's Burgers is an excellent show, funny, witty, not always in your face comedy, crude and entertaining. Some people may say that Bob's Burger shouldn't be with the Sunday line up which includes The Simpson's, Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, but in my opinion, The Simpson's isn't as good as before, Family Guy has been hit or miss this season (mostly miss), The Cleveland show is just a time filler. But as i expect it's either you love it or you hate it. lets just hope Bob's Burger doesn't suffer the same fate as the Hilarious Home Movies.\",\n",

Especially the girl with the pink hat. automatically, within 10 minutes of the pilot, a character is talking about their private parts. The fact that a female character has a guy's voice and talks about her sexuality is genius. I hope this show at least lasts two seasons at least. Again, their couldn't be a perfect time to have a show like this. With the departure of Michael Scott, and the Simpson's not being as funny, people gotta watch something.\",\n",

There are subtle family and coming of age lessons to be learned which is a nice addition. Furthermore, the violence is no where near the same level of violence seen in shows like South Park and Family Guy. The comedy can be a little dry from time to time but it works. The seemingly elementary approach and off the wall wittiness of the children make the comedy what it is. The episodes are very short so if you find the show lacking any real potential than just wait for the next.You wont be let down.',\n",

They got a few set movements and poses that gets recycled through the show. It makes the characters look stiff. As a computer guy I would find that in itself completely unwatchable.

Bobs Burgers is different. This is what I would call. \"A good a picture of a normal hard-working American family with normal hard-working American family dysfunctions.\" Each character is unique in their own way.Bob; being the hard-working bill paying father and husband,many can relate to.Bob is backed by his witty and always loving wife Linda. Like Bob\\'s role as father and husband, Linda is a wonderful depiction of a loving mother and wife. Always willing to stand up for her family and provide support to the people around her when they need it most.Then we have the kids. Starting with the oldest we have Tina a 13-year old erotic fiction (some times involving zombies)writing girl on the threshold of puberty, with a crush on a boy, who most of the time doesn\\'t even acknowledge her feelings. (Yet another relation a lot of people can make.) Next we have Gene;the middle child and the only boy. Gene also displays many tendency associated with kids his age (11.) Almost always seen with ether a sound effects microphone or a sound effects/piano keyboard. Interestingly both Gene and Bob have a hard time when it comes to father son bonding, except when it comes to watching old western movies.Last but certainly not least we have Louise. A far cry from the portrayal of an average 9-year old girl. While being both cleaver and cunning, as well as having a more advanced and knowledgeable mindset on certain matters (especially for her age.) She also has her charm and child like naivety at her disposable too. She is very skilled at making certain people do or act certain ways, often times this being used secretly for profit. As seen in Art Crawl. All this added up with her off beat and dark sense of humor make her may favorite character on the show.I want to close off my statement by saying not everyone will like this show. But I certainly hope it stays around for a long time. And with a fourth season on the way I may just may get my wish. Also, to whom it may concern I am not a rigged 10 star review placed here by the show\\'s creators to up its ratings, But a person who has finally found a good reason to actually turn their TV on.',\n",

The thought that this same psychological treatment would have led countless others into his trust, and ultimately their deaths, is far more terrifying in its cold reality than any conscious attempts at \"horror\" could have been.Janet doesn\\'t only represent the victims but also the vast majority of normal human beings - vulnerable to emotional needs, a willing and optimistic mindset, and the inability to always separate imagination from reality.A very fascinating angle on a difficult subject.',\n",

       "   {'content': \"APPROPRIATE ADULT may not be available on USA Format DVD as yet, but for those interested in seeing this remarkable achievement in filmmaking, it is viewable now on Sundance Channel. Watch for it. APPROPRIATE ADULT is one of the few films that relates the true story of a serial killer without resorting to forcing the audience to watch reenactments of the murders. Instead the writer, director and actors bring this savage bit of history to the screen solely through a serious of interview conducted with the killer in the presence of the British police and an 'Appropriate Adult' - one who has been trained to help the accused by detecting if the accused has learning difficulties or other encumbrances that might make the interviews invalid. First a bit of fact: 'Frederick Walter Stephen West (29 September 1941[1] - 1 January 1995), was a British serial killer. Between 1967 and 1987, he alone, and later, he and his wife Rosemary, tortured, raped and murdered at least 11 young women and girls, many at the couple's homes. The majority of the murders occurred between May 1973 and September 1979 at their home in Gloucester. Rosemary West also murdered Fred's stepdaughter (his first wife's biological daughter) Charmaine, while he was serving a prison sentence for theft. During this time they resided at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. The house was demolished in 1996 and was converted into a landscaped footpath connecting Cromwell Street to St. Michaels Square.' It is now believed that West was responsible for 20 other similarly executed murders. The film focuses on the Appropriate Adult Janet Leach (Emily Watson in an Oscar worthy performance), a trainee social worker who is asked by Gloucester police to sit in on the interrogations of Frederick West (played with extraordinary skill by Dominic West). West is a sociopath whose past of preying on women comes from the animal magnetism he owns, a factor which is strong enough to keep Janet on the case a Fred's assigned 'helper'. Janet lives with Mike (Anthony Flanagan) who is a bipolar victim and with whom Janet has three children. The tightrope of psychological stability for Janet is threatened by her hearing all the grisly details of the murders as well as facing a home where Mike stop his lithium and must be psychiatrically hospitalized. Janet is repulsed by what Fred unwinds and decides she cannot manage to remain the appropriate adult, but Fred sees her as his only friend and promises here that if she stays on the case he will tell her the truth about everything. The interviews are held in the presence of Detective Constable Hazel Savage (Sylvestra Le Tousel), Detective Superintendent John Bennett (Robert Glenister), West's assigned solicitor Howard Ogden (Gerald Horan) and Janet. There are moments when Fred tells Janet details he hasn't shared with the police, but because of her assigned role as appropriate adult she must hold these conversations with the murderer in confidence. There are times when the interrogation group accompanies Fred to his home to find the bodies buried in his garden and cellar, but these breaks are few and outside of the visits to Janet's home and to the hospital while Mike is institutionalized the film is claustrophobically viewed in the dank interrogation room. Once the interrogation is complete and hearings begin, Fred pleads with Janet to visit him in prison to share all the details of his life. The manner in which their relationship comes to an end is shocking but allows Janet to return to her home life with Mike and her three children: the paparazzi finally leave Janet alone.The story was written for the screen by Neil McKay and directed by Julian Jarrod. The film is approximately 2 1/2 hours in length, but the story is so fascinating and the acting is so incredibly fine on the part of everyone in this cast that the film itself feels short. Dominic West and Emily Watson are absolutely extraordinary in this film. With the quality of their performances it is doubtful the movie would have the enormous impact that it has. Grady Harp\",\n",

       "   {'content': \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Given popular culture's fixation with crime and particularly topics such as serial murderers, it was an inevitability that eventually a film (a TV movie, at least) would be made about the crimes of Fred and Rose West. It was even more inevitable that there would be an out cry that it would glamorize and thus cheapen the real life murders. But, the producers of Appropriate Adult took a novel approach and chose to focus not on the actual murders themselves, but, as the title suggests, the AA that it was felt needed to sit in during Fred West's police interviews on account of his apparent 'learning difficulties.' That woman was Janet Leach, played here by Emily Watson, who went on to sell her story to the tabloids but who also appeared to suffer a certifiable breakdown, after seemingly forming a bond with West, falling under his dark spell. In doing so, it casts an interesting light on the case, bringing up facts that I certainly didn't know before seeing it (i.e. Rose West being a prostitute) and serving to make an unpleasant tale even more unsavoury.As West, Coronation Street star Craig Charles had been in the running to play the role, but it appears to have gone to The Wire star Dominic West. I've never watched that show, so I can't compare him with what he's probably known best for, but he manages to bring West to life with an eerie darkness all of his own, interspersing his usual barrage of matter of fact recollections of his heinous crimes with the occasional emotional breakdown that reveals a vaguely human side to such a monster. It's his everyman appearance in general that makes him such an unnerving character. In support, Watson also seems like an eerily credible person, a woman desperately trying to stay professional in spite of hearing first hand accounts of crimes she can't accept are humanly possible, while still forming a bond with the perpetrator of these sick crimes.A drama about West was always going to be in the pipe line for one day, and this is a sensitively handled and none voyeuristic handling, that is relevant, enlightening and of course, very disturbing. ****\",\n",

       "   {'content': \"I first heard bits and pieces about the vicious and unbelievable murders of serial killers Fred and Rose West from jokes made on Mock the Week, so naturally I was curious to see one of the first dramatisations of the story. Basically, set in 1994, Gloucestershire, Janet Leach (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson) is the voluntary worker and social worker brought in to sit in the interviews to help with the investigation into a series of murders. The man in question requiring her presence is Frederick Walter Stephen West (300's BAFTA winning Dominic West, no relation), who is suspected of killing his daughter and an ex-wife, and soon enough he confesses in detail to a killing or two. As time goes by and Fred agrees to show the authorities where he put the remains of his victims, he also hints to Janet of more people he has killed, but because of her obligation of confidentiality to him she cannot tell the police. Meanwhile, she also seems to be forming an overly complicated personal relationship with Fred as he gains her trust to help him get back his family and house, but to do this he must promise to reveal all the people he has killed. Also being questioned about the various murders, which may total up to twenty or more victims, is Fred's wife Rosemary Pauline West, née Letts (BAFTA winning Monica Dolan), who is seen on screen mostly swearing a lot and shouting that she is innocent and to let her husband go. After confessing the people he has allegedly killed Fred is sentenced to a court hearing which obviously turns into a life sentence, and Janet is forced but also obliged to continue the relationship with Fred in prison. The police continue their examination of the sights Fred pointed out, the bodies that have been found, and whether Rose is indeed guilty of killing as well, and Janet has a final telephone conversation with Fred. This is before the next day when he was found dead from hanging himself, Janet's husband realises that she may have had some bond towards the serial killer, like a friend. In the end, after Janet is slowly moving on with her own life with her husband and children Rose is the one who left to stand trial and she is indeed found guilty for many of the countless murders and sentenced to life imprisonment, advised never to be released. Also starring Hustle's Robert Glenister as Detective Superintendent John Bennett, Sylvestra Le Touzel as Detective Constable Hazel Savage, Anthony Flanagan as Mike, Samuel Roukin as Detective Constable Darren Law, Gerard Horan as Howard Ogden, Seline Hizli as Mae West, James McArdle as Stephen West, Rupert Simonian as Josh, Sophie Downham as Jade, Jasper Jacob as Brian Leveson QC, Robert Whitelock as DC Carl Kempinsky and Paula Williamson as Kirsty Stephens, and featuring the voices of real reports from Sir Trevor McDonald, John Suchet and Radio 1's Steve Scott. What is extraordinary about this dramatisation of the story is that it does not need to sensationalise any of the reported or discovered events, i.e. we never see any murders committed or see any bodies brought up from under the garden soil or the patio, this by the way is all I have heard about the murders, mostly from jokes made. Watson is fantastic as the social worker protagonist who sits and walks through the movements of the serial killer and finds some kind of odd but plausible need to be near him, and Dolan is really good as the swearing and equally dangerous Rose, but of course the show is stolen by the superb performance from West putting on an authentic Gloucestershire accent and is completely believable and powerful as the killer who acts calm but also nervous, but is not afraid when asked to describe in vivid detail about his murders and where the bodies can be found. I have had bad experiences with television dramas in the past, only Goodnight Mister Tom stands out as one of the truly brilliant ones, but I was pleasantly surprised by this utterly compelling and astoundingly played and scripted story of shocking murder and inhuman activity, played very calmly but fantastically engaging, superb crime drama. It won the BAFTA for Breakthrough Talent, and it was nominated for Best Director: Fiction for Julian Jarrold, Best Mini-Series, Best Production Design and Best Writer. Very good!\",\n",

       "   {'content': 'Emily Watson, one of the great actors of our time, gives a superb performance as Janet Leach that may well be the finest work she has ever done. She is nothing less than hypnotic here as she lays bare the soul of a vulnerable woman who is involved in an experience she is completely unprepared for. While the portrait of Leach is profound and an incredible achievement, Watson doesn\\'t get in our faces with her ACTING because she is almost invisible as she disappears into the character. What a truly memorable, stunning performance this is. The entire cast is excellent, as are all elements of the production, including writing and direction. However, it is Emily Watson who elevates this film to an artistic level of depth and realism that makes it totally riveting. There is no attempt by Watson to draw attention to herself and \"steal\" the film. \"Gosford Park\" is another example of how she shines in an ensemble piece and it naturally becomes her showcase. Her style is not flashy enough and far too superbly subtle to win Oscars. There isn\\'t the teeth gnashing PERFORMANCE style of a Charlize Theron in \"Monster\", the sort of Halle Berry one-shot fluke that brings home the gold. Watson is an artist in the truest sense and it\\'s her work alone that is her reward. In this film, what she does is so extraordinary, even for her, that perhaps the praise of critics will this time cause award committees and voters to take note of an actor they have too long overlooked because she never yells \"look at me!\" At any rate, reward yourself by watching an excellent film with an outstanding actress at her best, as usual.',\n",

       "   {'content': \"Serial killers are thankfully rare, and almost by definition not normal. But Fred West was particularly peculiar, and is brilliantly captured here by Dominic West in the television drama 'Appropriate Adult'. The drama tells the story from the perspective of a woman (Janet Leach) who acted as a lay adviser to West during his interrogations; it's a way of avoiding the grizzly schlock inherent in the subject matter, although it also removes much of the dramatic potential - Leach had an ordeal in the witness box, owing to her contact with a national newspaper, but fundamentally did not have so much at stake as the Wests themselves, or the families of their victims. But if not that dramatic, the story is certainly compelling. Gordon Burn wrote a book on the case called 'Happy Like Murderers'; the appropriateness of this bizarre title is conveyed here as well. If it hadn't really happened, you couldn't have made it up. The grimmest truth is that there may still be further bodies out there\",\n",

       "   {'content': \"After conquering stage and screen and making them her own with a talent both exquisite and overwhelming, Ms. Emily Watson assaults the small screen and is once again victorious. She is absolutely stunning as she assays the role of Janet Leech, interpreting a character so sublimely that it takes the breath away from the unprepared casual viewer who is somehow unaware of Ms. Watson's incredible acting genius. Ordinairly, she alone would make this film a personal gem in her crown but she bows to the rest of the cast and humbly assists them in giving performances well worth her association. Watson inspires others to greatness, as she almost did even with Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk love. In that film, neither her lovely presence and creative power could quite achieve the impossible with Sandler. However, what she does with the more substantial material of West here and with a brilliant script is amazing. She was awarded the BAFTA for her accomplishment and of course lost the EMMY to a Hollywood airhead tootsie of limited ability but a casting couch regular. True magisterial talent is usually unrecognized by Oscar and EMMY and the outrage one feels at Watson having neither been awarded the recognition she more than deserves speaks for itself. More than an outrage, it is a disgusting and repellent act of ignorance and cowardice for her to have ever left any ceremony empty-handed. Britain, however, could not in this case turn their eyes away from a performance so powerfully moving, a performance that will live for all time, and define the artistry of a gifted, supreme actor. Emily Watson's performance in Appropriate Adult is one of the finest ever recorded on film and will forever serve as an example of the national treasure she continues to be as she assays one brilliant role after another. This is simply not to be missed by anyone appreciative of an artist at the pinnacle of her career and a beautiful genius whose very presence is beyond price. Emily Watson is a rare gift to literate theater and film audiences everywhere and the finest actor of her own generation as well as all others.\",\n",

       "   {'content': '\"Appropriate Adult\" from 2011 is based on the Fred and Rosemary West murder case. A social worker in training, Janet Leach (Emily Watson) is brought in by Gloucester police as the \"appropriate adult\" at the interrogation of Fred West (Dominic West), thought to be a little on the simple side. He and his wife Rosemary (Monica Dolan) have been accused of killing their daughter and burying the body in their garden.Fred says right up front that he wants to set the record straight. He tells a story of his daughter wanting to leave home, that she said something nasty to him, and he grabbed her by the throat. Suddenly she turned blue. He tried mouth to mouth but she seemed to get worse. Well, what to do. So he got an ice breaker to cut off her legs so he could stuff her somewhere and then Rosemary wouldn\\'t see her.When asked why he didn\\'t tell the police this before, Fred says, \"Well, I wasn\\'t ready.\" Anyway he claims Rosemary knew nothing about it. He is so casual and matter-of-fact, listening to him is shocking.Fred seems to take to Janet, so he confides in her, again, casually, that there are more bodies, around nine. Since anything he tells her is confidential, she can\\'t repeat what he said. Later he talks about the love of his life, Anna, and Janet discovers that she bears a resemblance to her. He seems to be very dependent on her.Janet has her own problems - children and a bipolar partner who has gone off his meds.Once his interrogation is over, Fred begs her to visit him in prison. Thinking he might give her more info and implicate Rosemary, she visits him several times.This is a terrific psychological drama. It kind of reminded me of what actually happened to Capote in the Cutter case, where Perry Smith bonded with him, or so Capote believed. I think he tried all along to manipulate him, as I think Fred here played Janet. Janet is not fooled by him, but there is something about him claiming that he needed her that keeps her coming back and makes her feel important out of the chaos of her home.Emily Watson is fantastic - quiet, unassuming, very committed, and by the book, who becomes more involved than she planned, and who can\\'t forget the horrors that Fred tells her. And Dominic West is simply astonishing - no emotion as he talks about the killings, talks about Anna being the love of his life, and how Rosemary, who is in prison under suspicion, must get out of prison to keep the family together. As if there is a family and Rosemary is not a prostitute.Monica Dolan as Rosemary is mean as dirt. It\\'s a great performance - she\\'s hateful.Highly recommended. A very unsettling story of a normal woman who comes face to face with the unimaginable.',\n",

In every scene he us mesmerising and you can feel the power of persuasion his characters had on women.The power of the story is also made by how ordinary events seem. The supporting characters do not try to outshine the leads; this is not a show with quirky cops solving cases. It shows the mundane and procedural efforts required of the constabulary even when such a heinous set of crimes are being investigated.This could very easily have been one of those dire woman-who-carries- the-load-let-down-by-men stories that get churned out in England with such dire monotony.

       "   {'content': \"The Fred and Rosemary West murders on 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, Englandcertainly overshadow the Moors Murders that occurred in the early 1960s. To anybody who has read about the case, it's baffling to see a married couple like Fred and Rose (your next door neighbors) involved in some of the country's most heinous crimes to date. Separately Rose and Fred were toxic as poison but together committed crimes against humanity against innocent young women including two of their daughters. The cast does a brilliant job in bringing the characters to life. The Wests are not sympathetic people at all but Dominic West and Monica Dolan did deserve their awards. The series of events is taken by the appropriate adult, Janet Leech, who is assigned to Fred West. Emily Watson plays Janet Leech, a mother and wife to a bipolar man. Watson did a fantastic job. Dominic West did a superb job in bringing one of the most despicable murders to life. Monica Dolan also did a superb job playing Rose West, a candidate for the worst mother ever. Sylvestra Le Touzel plays police officer Hazel Savage MBE who went searching for Heather West. It was Heather's disappearance that launched an investigation. Hazel and Janet Leech were unsung heroines in this case. Hazel was awarded MBE for her services to the police. Hazel was a veteran police officer and perhaps the inspiration.\",\n",

A social work student is asked to act as an 'Appropriate Adult' for a guy in a police station who is dressed in a normal fashion, no chains or even handcuffs. The fellow speaks in a matter of fact manner about having problems with his daughter, who threatened to give LSD to her younger siblings, and the father says he loses control and chokes her. The fellow then is left alone with the 'AA' and makes some chilling remarks to her. The police are shown digging up the guy's backyard with him again, not in handcuffs, speaking knowledgeably about using some tools.Basically, that's the pattern of the whole movie, and while it's kind of creepy, it gets kind of monotonous after a while, and I found myself wishing that the film would just end. Certainly, the two leads give good performances, but the director doesn't help them much in his choice of presenting the story in the manner of a play, rather than as a work of cinema.\",\n",

       "   {'content': 'I find I\\'m the skunk at the garden party with this flick. I found this highly acclaimed docudrama repellent, but not for the reasons one might suspect. It was repellent - as well as incomprehensible - to watch Leach\\'s developing interest and fascination with Fred West. Anyone watching this movie should first do some Googling to find out the details of what Fred and Rosemary West perpetrated. If anyone deserves to be called human monsters, it is this pair. In the light of this knowledge, the script\\'s clear intention - to me anyway - to actually make West into a figure of sympathy is disgusting. Knowing the nature of his deeds, his weeping and the crying about the \"baby\" (complete with colorful regional pronunciation of the word) are repulsive. It was also interesting to see the British treatment of prisoners in interrogation: allowed to wear their own clothes (no prison uniforms) and pretty much conducted like afternoon tea. As at least one other critic has observed, it is incomprehensible how any morally sentient human being could develop any sympathy with this fiend, as Leach evidently did. As the relationship between Leach and West is at the core of this narrative, and her motivation remains unexplained if not inexplicable, the whole movie does not wash.It was nice of the producers to include the photos of the actual victims in the closing credits. During the movie itself there is minimal emotion at their loss; the burial of their remains is portrayed with as much moral weight as the burial of a pickle jar.',\n",

A sense of overwhelming dread and discomfort permeates the film from beginning to end and heightens the intensity throughout.

This show brings the same heartwarming feelings with a story line from what seems to be an even smaller town.The people of Brookfield seem just as close-knit as those of their fellow pioneers of Hope Valley. However, they are still in their growing pains. One hotel, no saloon, two ranchers (even though we primarily see only the one ranch) and others required for a town to thrive (Bakery, Grocer, Infirmary, etc.).The story line can be a bit slow at times, but then again so was the story line of \"When Calls the Heart\" at times. So far, I really like where the show is going and look forward to seeing where things wind up.If you were an avid fan of \"When Calls the Heart\", I encourage you to give this show a chance. Watch a few episodes and it will grow on you. This one could be a hit.The only dislike I have about this show is the fact that it\\'s on Hallmark Now (a subscription service) and not available for mainstream viewing. This is the only thing that I think will not work in favor of the show.They did a special of showing the first two episodes on Hallmark Channel, but I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be enough to get the potential viewership that they could really go after.It seems the show was a front burner idea to get people to subscribe to the new streaming subscription channel, but I don\\'t think it will get enough people to sign up for this show to survive.For this show to survive, it needs to be aired fully on Hallmark so that it can attract the attention, love, and devotion of the rest of us that feel like Hope Valley is a second home.',\n",

       "   {'content': 'I\\'m loving and really enjoying \"When Hope Calls!!\" Everything about it is fantastic!!!! The storylines each week, the acting, the sets, the wardrobe, all of it! I\\'m always so exited when the next episode is available, to see the next chapter of this quaint, family-friendly story and the characters\\' adventures! Everyone involved with the show continues to do a brilliant job!! I recommend it to anyone I think will love it and who already enjoys movies/shows of the genre, especially \"When Calls the Heart!\" \"When Hope Calls\" definitely holds it\\'s own, while still giving off a \"When Calls the Heart\" vibes, especially when someone from Hope Valley visits, which I love!! 10/10 definitely recommend!!! Brava!! #Hearties',\n",
