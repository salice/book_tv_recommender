This quality of sitcom doesn\\'t come along very often. Tom Basden and Sam Leifer have created a classic. I hope and pray that series 2 is as good as the first. I have watched the six episodes over and over and introduced it to every house guest that has passed through our front door.Why is it so good? It follows the traditional structure of a great many British sitcoms from the past; repeated situations that vary only slightly from week to week but are always funny; classic characters that you instantly feel you know personally. It creates realistic situations that make ancient Rome relevant and funny. And it only uses bad language to punctuate and add humour rather than to pep-up an otherwise lacklustre script.Marcus, Stylax and Grumio are the Three Stooges of ancient Rome... though one is obviously from somewhere near Manchester. They\\'re at times stupid, manipulative, gross, lazy, utterly seethru, charming, laddish and totally plebeian. But they\\'re all lovable and completely real. Each is a completely necessary foil for the others and all are superbly played by a wonderful and very talented cast. No plot spoilers, just go and buy it! Every performance in it is wonderful, from the slick landlord to the Essex-girl-next-door with her sharp-as-a-tack slave. From the man-eater boss to the corporate memo writer. Then of course there is the fabulous Waterboy (sorry, Waterman) played by one of the show\\'s writers, Tom Basden (have a look at his own YouTube videos).A word about the show\\'s music too... Baba Brooks? Toots and the Maytals? In ancient Rome? I don\\'t know why but it\\'s just perfect!You\\'ve probably guessed by now that I LOVE IT.SECOND SERIES - sad updateWhat a disappointment! We\\'ve gone from the most promising TV comedy in years to lowest common denominator garbage in one fell swoop. So far I have seen the first two episodes of series two. In the first we\\'re given the spectacle of Marcus performing oral sex on a prostitute and in the second the lads vistit a site to experience oral sex from old men through a hole in wooden fence. Hilarious... not. When you have to stoop to this for laughs you\\'ve run out of ideas. If we want porn there are a billion websites waiting to take our money. It\\'s not necessary to include it in a TV show to get cheap laughs. I am no prude. The language is fine, the inuendo is fine. There just isn\\'t the need for this extra gyno comedy. The Marcus from series one just hasn\\'t got it in him to perform cunnilingus with an older woman on his first date... let alone on a kitchen table. Marcus would not carry Grumio on his shoulders during a chariot race. It would be the other way round. The character of Davus is completely unnecessary. I can go on and on... The show has had more money chucked at it, CGI, fancy camera angles and a drugged up, sexed up script. It\\'s as bad as series 3 of the Mighty Boosh. Dudes... Fawlty Towers and Father Ted didn\\'t stray into these murky waters. They\\'re classics. They\\'re clever. This is junk. Shame on you.

It certainly benefits from the epoch and the public\\'s perceptions and misconceptions about ancient Rome. It\\'s about young singles in a city.

Slaves, gladiators and corporate orgies are difficult to joke about in a contemporary environment. I think this production has managed to use the collision between todays ethics and historical peculiarities really good. Personally I think the first three episodes felt a little shaky and immature . Six episodes (shown this far) are to few for a fair rating when it comes to this kind of show. It feels like the series is only in its infancy. The series has potential. It feels like it can develop allot more. Give the character an honest chance so perhaps Plebs could become a real classic in the British humor flora. Each episode is a sweet waste of 30 minutes.
